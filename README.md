# InterSystems IRIS Full Stack QuickStart

This QuickStart is designed to run in the InterSystems Sandbox environment, so [follow the exercise online here](https://play.instruqt.com/embed/intersystems/tracks/iris-for-health?token=em_IEo0iBDc0fgagpas).

In it, you create the basic information management infrastructure for a small manufacturing company. In this case, the company will be roasting, packaging and selling delicious, freshly roasted coffee beans. Along the way, youâ€™ll learn how the InterSystems IRIS data platform can serve as the backbone of your IT architecture.

The QuickStart is divided into three parts and introduces the processes that you, as a coffee manufacturer, follow to set up everything from inventorying raw coffee beans to selling them in an online portal.

- **Part 1:** Write SQL to create and populate databases.
- **Part 2:** Build a RESTful API to handle business functions using ObjectScript.
- **Part 3:** Build an online storefront to sell your artisan coffee beans using the popular JavaScript framework, Vue.js.
